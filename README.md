## Original task:
### The Grocery List App

I live with two roommates. We go grocery shopping together every other Tuesday. There are some items that we purchase every week – things like milk, cereal, and a selection of gourmet cheeses. In addition, each of us chooses a different recipe to make that we will eat together as part of a 'family meal.' Keeping track of all of these items is complicated – we need a tool to help us keep track of what to buy. Let's call it _Basket_.
